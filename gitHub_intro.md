## Pull Requests & Code Reviews


## 🔍 Pull Requests & Code Reviews

The secret to professional collaboration:

1. **Pull Requests (PRs)**: Propose changes to a repository
2. **Code Reviews**: Get feedback before merging code
3. **Protected Branches**: Prevent direct pushes to main
4. **Merge Strategies**: Choose how to combine code changes

## Basic PR Workflow

1. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. **Make your changes** (edit files, add features, fix bugs)
3. **Stage changes**: `git add .` (or `git add specific-file.txt`)
4. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Add feature"`
5. **Push to GitHub**: `git push origin feature-name`
6. **Open Pull Request** on GitHub
7. **Address review comments** (if any)
8. **Merge when approved**

## 🏁 What to Do Next?

✅ Create a GitHub account
✅ Upload your first Python file
✅ Share your GitHub username with your team

## 🤖 GitHub Actions & Automation

GitHub isn't just for storing code - it can automatically test and deploy it too!

- **CI/CD**: Set up workflows that automatically test your code when you push
- **Automated Testing**: Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Deployment**: Automatically deploy your app when code is merged to main
- **Custom Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks like formatting or documentation

Example workflow file (`.github/workflows/python-test.yml`):
```yaml
name: Python Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install pytest
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: pytest
```

## 📋 Project Management with GitHub

GitHub has built-in tools to manage your projects:

- **Issues**: Track bugs, features, and tasks
- **Projects**: Kanban boards to visualize your workflow
- **Milestones**: Group issues into larger goals
- **Labels**: Categorize issues by type, priority, etc.
- **Discussions**: Have conversations about your code

Pro tip: Use keywords in commits to automatically close issues!
Example: `git commit -m "Fix login bug, closes #42"`
