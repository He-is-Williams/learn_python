Day 1: Introduction to Python and Development Environment Setup 
==============================================================

Learning Objectives:
- Understand what Python is and why it's popular
- Set up Python development environment
- Learn basic Git commands for version control
- Create and manage GitHub repositories
"""

# ========================
# WHAT IS PYTHON?
# ========================

"""
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for:
- Simple and readable syntax
- Versatility (web development, data science, automation, AI/ML)
- Large community and extensive libraries
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Beginner-friendly approach

Popular uses of Python:
- Web Development (Django, Flask)
- Data Science & Analytics (Pandas, NumPy)
- Machine Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Automation & Scripting
- Game Development
- Desktop Applications
"""

# ========================
# DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
# ========================

"""
Essential Tools for Python Development:

1. Python Interpreter:
   - Download from python.org
   - Verify installation: python --version

2. Code Editor/IDE:
   - VS Code (recommended for beginners)
   - PyCharm
   - Sublime Text
   - Vim/Neovim

3. Package Manager:
   - pip (comes with Python)
   - Used to install external libraries

4. Virtual Environment:
   - venv (built-in Python module)
   - Keeps project dependencies isolated

# ========================
# GIT & VERSION CONTROL
# ========================

"""
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in code.

KEY GIT CONCEPTS:
- Repository (repo): A project folder tracked by Git
- Commit: A snapshot of your code at a specific point
- Branch: A separate line of development
- Remote: A version of your repository stored online (like GitHub)

ESSENTIAL GIT COMMANDS:

1. Setup and Configuration:
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

2. Repository Operations:
   git init                    # Initialize a new Git repository
   git clone <repository-url>  # Copy a remote repository to local machine
   git status                  # Check current status of your repository

3. Tracking Changes:
   git add <filename>          # Stage specific file for commit
   git add .                   # Stage all changes for commit
   git commit -m "message"     # Create a snapshot with a descriptive message

4. Remote Repository Operations:
   git pull                    # Download and merge changes from remote repository
   git push                    # Upload your commits to remote repository
   git fetch                   # Check for changes without merging

5. Branching:
   git branch                  # List all branches
   git branch <branch-name>    # Create a new branch
   git checkout <branch-name>  # Switch to a branch
   git merge <branch-name>     # Merge a branch into current branch
"""

# ========================
# GITHUB WORKFLOW
# ========================

"""
GitHub Workflow We Followed:

1. ‚úÖ Created GitHub accounts
2. ‚úÖ Created a new private repository
3. ‚úÖ Added collaborators to the repository
4. ‚úÖ Learned about forking (creating a copy of someone else's repository)
5. ‚úÖ Created and managed branches
6. ‚úÖ Cloned repository to local machine using:
   git clone <repository-url>

BEST PRACTICES:
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Commit frequently with small, logical changes
- Use branches for new features or experiments
- Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Review changes before committing

# NEXT STEPS

"""
What's Coming Next:

Day 2: Basic Python syntax, printing, and comments
Day 3: Variables, data types, and naming conventions
Day 4: Operators and expressions
Day 5: Control structures (if/else statements)

HOMEWORK:
1. Ensure Python is properly installed on your system
2. Set up VS Code with Python extension
3. Create a test Python file and run: print("Hello, Python!")
4. Practice basic Git commands in your repository
