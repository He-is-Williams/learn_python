""" Day 3: Variables and Data Types """

# Variable naming rules and conventions
"""
GOOD variable names:
- age, first_name, total_price
- user_id, max_speed, is_valid

BAD variable names:
- 1age (can't start with number)
- first-name (no hyphens)
- class (reserved keyword)

Python naming conventions:
- Use lowercase with underscores: my_variable
- Constants in UPPERCASE: MAX_SIZE = 100
- Classes use PascalCase: MyClass
