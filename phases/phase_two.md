Perfect! Let's dive deep into Phase 2. I'll create a comprehensive guide covering all these intermediate concepts with practical examples.I've created a comprehensive guide covering all Phase 2 topics! Here's what we covered:

## 🎯 **Functions & Scope**
- Function definition, parameters, and return values
- `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexible functions
- Global vs local scope and the `global` keyword
- Lambda functions for quick operations
- Basic decorators with practical examples

## 📁 **File Handling & Error Management**
- Reading/writing text files with proper `with` statements
- JSON and CSV file handling with practical examples
- Comprehensive exception handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`)
- Custom exceptions and error management strategies

## 🏗️ **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Classes, objects, and instance variables
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism in action with animal examples
- Encapsulation with public/protected/private attributes
- Special methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.)

## 📦 **Modules & Packages**
- Different import styles and best practices
- Creating custom modules
- Understanding `if __name__ == "__main__"`
- Package structure and `__init__.py`
- Virtual environments for project isolation

## 🚀 **Practice Suggestions:**

1. **Build a Simple Library System:**
   - Create Book and Library classes
   - Handle file I/O for saving/loading books
   - Use exception handling for invalid operations

2. **Create a Personal Finance Tracker:**
   - Use classes for accounts and transactions
   - Save data to JSON files
   - Handle input validation with custom exceptions

3. **Make a Text Processing Module:**
   - Create functions for text analysis
   - Package it as a reusable module
   - Include file reading capabilities
