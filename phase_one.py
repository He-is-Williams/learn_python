# Python Foundations - Phase 1 Complete Guide

"""
Welcome to Python! This guide covers all the fundamental concepts you need
to start your Python journey. By the end, you'll understand:

1. Core Syntax & Concepts
2. Control Flow (if statements, loops)
3. Basic problem-solving with Python

# Variable naming rules and conventions

GOOD variable names:
- age, first_name, total_price
- user_id, max_speed, is_valid

BAD variable names:
- 1age (can't start with number)
- first-name (no hyphens)
- class (reserved keyword)

Python naming conventions:
- Use lowercase with underscores: my_variable
- Constants in UPPERCASE: MAX_SIZE = 100
- Classes use PascalCase: MyClass

Python Interactive Shell (REPL - Read-Eval-Print Loop):

Example session:

5
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> print(f"Hello, {name}")
Hello, Alice
>>> exit()

Useful interactive commands:
- help(function_name) - Get help
- dir(object) - List attributes/methods
- type(variable) - Check variable type
- exit() or quit() - Exit Python shell
